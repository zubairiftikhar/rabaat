We do not endorse, control, or take responsibility for content, policies, or services provided by third-party sites. If you choose to engage with third-party websites, you should review their terms separately.

            The content available on Rabaat is current as of its publication date and may become outdated due to market changes. We do not offer financial, legal, or investment advice, and no part of our services should be interpreted as an endorsement, sale, or solicitation of financial products.

            Third-party offers and deals will always be honored.

            6. Legal Disputes & Governing Law
            These terms are governed by the laws of Pakistan. Any disputes related to your use of Rabaat‚Äôs services will be subject to confidential arbitration in Pakistan.

            Exceptions apply if a user has violated our intellectual property rights, in which case we may seek legal action in a relevant court of law. The arbitration process will be conducted in English, and the decision made by the arbitrator will be legally binding.

            By agreeing to these terms, you waive any right to join arbitration proceedings with other users. If arbitration is legally restricted in your region, disputes will be handled by the Pakistani courts.
